        <div><h3>Strengths</h3>
            <p>IKEA has many strengths such as low cost, high quality, sustainability efforts, a morale boosting corporate culture, and extensive in-store amenities such as child-care, restaurant, as well as car racks customers can rent.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div><h3>Weaknesses</h3>
            <p>IKEAâ€™s main weakness is its lack of online support. There are few things that can be purchased online and the things that can be purchased come with an incredibly large shipping fee. There are no store-pickup options and no way to reserve items at a store.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div><h3>Opportunities</h3>
            <p>BluDot.com is a direct competitor of IKEA with a more convenient online shopping experience. The furniture
                is very similar to IKEA furniture and while the price is more expensive, there are more customization options
                and lower shipping costs
                </p>
        </div>
        <div><h3>Threats</h3>
            <p>IKEA is an incredibly successful business with an established and respected brand, and they should continue to expand their business in the United States. With only 38 stores, there is a lot of opportunity for growth there
