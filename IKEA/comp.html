    <p>BluDot.com is a direct competitor of IKEA with very
        similar designs, an easier online interface, and more
        color options. However, the prices of BluDot’s
        products doesn’t come close to the low cost of IKEA.
        For online shopping, it is superior to IKEA, but for
        customers that prioritize money over convenience,
        shopping directly at IKEA stores is the best option.</p>
    <p>There are other options frugal customers have: WalMart and Target, for example, offer products that
        while not living up to IKEA’s level of quality and
        workmanship are very aesthetically similar and offer
        competitive pricing. Ordering online is easy with these companies but if a customer decides to shop in the
        brick-and-mortar store, there is less chaos and the process is overall much simpler than shopping at IKEA.</p>
    <p>Wal-Mart and Target, and other big-box stores that offer furniture options, besides have better shipping
        options and overall online support, also have a competitive advantage over IKEA in that there are more
        brick-and-mortar stores in the US. There are only 38 IKEA stores in the United States. In stark contrast, there
        are 4,177 Wal-Marts and 1,934 Target stores in the United States.
        Despite the fact that Wal-Mart and Target and other big-box stores offer better online support, more brickand-mortar stores, and greater convenience; IKEA offers superior sustainability efforts, has better socially
        responsible practices, offers higher-quality products, and offers a better cache than other stores.</p>
